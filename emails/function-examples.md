## Functions in Python

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They allow you to organize your code into modular and logical components, making it easier to read, understand, and maintain. Here are some simple examples of functions in Python:

### Example 1: No Parameter/Argument Function

```python
def greet():
    # Function to greet the user
    print("Hello, There! Nice to meet you.")

# Call the greet() function to execute the code inside it
greet()
```

- The `greet()` function is defined without any parameters.
- When called, it prints a greeting message.

### Example 2: Looping User Input

```python
def print_user_input():
    # Function to repeatedly take user input and print it
    while True:
        user_input = input("Enter number: ")
        print(user_input)
        if user_input == "quit":
            break

# Call the print_user_input() function to execute the code inside it
print_user_input()
```

- The `print_user_input()` function uses a `while` loop to repeatedly take user input and print it.
- The loop continues until the user enters "quit".

### Example 3: Reverse String

```python
def reverse_string():
    # Function to reverse a string entered by the user
    name = input("Enter your name: ")
    for i in range(len(name)-1, -1, -1):
        print(name[i], end="")

# Call the reverse_string() function to execute the code inside it
reverse_string()
```

- The `reverse_string()` function prompts the user to enter their name and reverses the input string.
- It accomplishes the reversal by using a `for` loop with the `range()` function.
- The `range(len(name)-1, -1, -1)` generates a sequence of indices in reverse order, starting from the last index of the string and ending at index 0.
- In each iteration of the loop, the loop variable `i` represents an index value from the generated sequence.
- The character at the index `i` is accessed using `name[i]`.
- By printing each character in reverse order, the function effectively reverses the input string.
- Using `print(name[i], end="")` ensures that the reversed characters are printed on the same line, creating the effect of reversing the string. Without `end=""`, each character would be printed on a separate line, resulting in the reversed string being displayed vertically instead of horizontally.

### Example 4: Two Times Table

```python
def two_times_table():
    # Function to print the two times table from 1 to 10
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(2 * i)

# Call the two_times_table() function to execute the code inside it
two_times_table()
```

- The `two_times_table()` function uses a `for` loop to print the two times table from 1 to 10.
- The loop iterates over the numbers generated by the `range(1, 11)` function.
- In each iteration, the loop variable `i` takes on a value from the sequence generated by the `range()` function.
- Multiplying `i` by 2 (`2 * i`) produces the corresponding number in the two times table.
- The result is printed, giving the complete two times table.

### Example 5: Function with Parameters

```python
def add(num1, num2):
    # Function to add two numbers and print the result
    print(num1 + num2)

# Call the add() function with two arguments to execute the code inside it
add(5, 3)
```

- The `add()` function takes two parameters (`num1` and `num2`) and adds them together.
- The sum of the two numbers is printed, providing the result of the addition.

### Example 6: Function with Parameters and Arguments

```python
def greeting(name):
    # Function to greet a person by their name
    print("Hello " + name)

# Call the greeting() function with different arguments to execute the code inside it
greeting("Luyanda")
greeting("Konke")
```

- The `greeting()` function takes one parameter (`name`) and prints a greeting message using the provided name.
- When calling the function, different arguments can be passed to greet different individuals.

### Example 7: Return Function

```python
def multiply(num1, num2):
    # Function to multiply two numbers and return the result
    result = num1 * num2
    return result

# Call the multiply() function with two arguments and store the returned value in a variable
res = multiply(2, 3)
print(res)
```

- The `multiply()` function takes two parameters (`num1` and `num2`), multiplies them, and returns the result.
- The returned value is stored in a variable (`res`) and printed.

### Example 8: Return Function to Reverse a String

```python
def reverse(string):
    # Function to reverse a given string and return the reversed string
    rev_str = ""
    for i in range(len(string)-1, -1, -1):
        rev_str = rev_str + string[i]
    return rev_str

# Call the reverse() function with a string argument and store the returned value in a variable
res = reverse("luyanda")
print(res)
```

- The `reverse()` function takes a string parameter and reverses the string by iterating over it in reverse order.
- It creates an empty string (`rev_str`) to store the reversed string.
- Using a `for` loop with the `range()` function, it generates a sequence of indices in reverse order, starting from the last index and ending at the first index of the string.
- In each iteration of the loop, the character at the current index (`i`) is appended to the `rev_str` string using string concatenation (`rev_str = rev_str + string[i]`).
- Finally, the reversed string is returned as the result and stored in a variable (`res`) before being printed.
