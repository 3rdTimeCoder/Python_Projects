#### Displaying numbers in a pattern

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    for j in range(1, i+1):
        print(j, end=' ')
    print()
```

- The outer loop iterates from 1 to 5, representing the rows of the pattern.
- The inner loop iterates from 1 to the current row number, representing the numbers to be printed in each row.
- The `print(j, end=' ')` statement prints the current number `j` followed by a space.
- The `print()` statement is used to print a newline character after each row.

#### Displaying numbers from -10 to -1 using a for loop

```python
for i in range(-10, 0, 1):
    print(i)
```

- The for loop iterates from -10 to 0 (exclusive) with a step of 1.
- The loop variable `i` takes on each value from -10 to -1, and it is printed using the `print(i)` statement.

#### Calculating the sum of numbers from 1 to 10

```python
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
s = 0
for i in range(1, num+1, 1):
    s = s + i
print(s)
```

- The program prompts the user to enter a number using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `num`.
- The variable `s` is initialized to 0 to hold the sum of numbers.
- The for loop iterates from 1 to `num` (inclusive) and adds each number `i` to the sum `s` using the statement `s = s + i`.
- Finally, the total sum is printed using the `print(s)` statement.

#### Displaying a pattern of stars

```python
n = 5

for row in range(1, n+1):
    for col in range(1, row + 1):
        print("*", end=" ")
    print()

for row in range(n-1, 0, -1):
    for col in range(row, 0, -1):
        print("*", end=" ")
    print()
```

- The first loop iterates over the rows from 1 to 5, representing the number of rows in the pattern.
- The second loop iterates from 1 to the current row number, representing the number of stars to be printed in each row.
- The `print("*", end=" ")` statement prints a star followed by a space.
- The `print()` statement is used to print a newline character after each row.
- After the first loop, a similar loop is used to print the pattern of decreasing stars.

#### Displaying a grid of stars

```python
n = 5

for row in range(1, n+1):
    for col in range(1, n+1):
        print("*", end=" ")
    print()
```

- The first loop iterates over the rows from 1 to 5, representing the number of rows in the grid.
- The second loop iterates over the columns from 1 to 5, representing the number of columns in the grid.
- The `print("*", end=" ")` statement prints a star followed by a space.
- The `print()` statement is used to print a newline character after each row.
- This results in a 5x5 grid of stars being displayed.

#### Counting the total number of digits in a number

```python
n = 4567
count = 0

while n != 0:
    n = n // 10
    count = count + 1

print(count)
```

- The code uses a while loop to count the number of digits in a given number.
- It initializes the `count` variable to 0.
- In each iteration of the while loop, the value of `n` is divided by 10 using integer division (`n = n // 10`).
- By performing integer division, the rightmost digit of the number is removed.
- The updated value of `n` is then reassigned back to `n`, allowing us to continue dividing it by 10 in the next iteration.
- The loop continues until `n` becomes 0, which means we have removed all the digits from the original number.
- In each iteration, we also increment the `count` variable by 1 to keep track of the number of digits we have removed.
- After the while loop completes, the final value of `count` represents the total number of digits in the input number.

#### Adding an else block to a for loop

```python
n = 4
for i in range(0, n+1):
    print(i)
print("Done")
```

- The for loop iterates from 0 to a given number `n`.
- The numbers from 0 to `n` are printed using the `print(i)` statement.
- After the for loop, the message "Done" is printed using the `print("Done")` statement.
- The else block is not necessary in this case since it will always be executed after the for loop, but it demonstrates the usage of the else block with a for loop.

These explanations should provide a clear understanding of each code snippet and its purpose.
