# Python_Projects

A collection of mini Python projects that I have developed.

## Sorters

The Sorters project consists of two scripts that organize files and music into appropriate folders based on specific criteria.

### music_sorter.py

This script allows you to sort music files into folders based on either the artist or the album. It requires the installation of the `mutagen` library.

**Requirements:** 
- Install `mutagen` by running `pip install mutagen`.

**Usage:**
1. Run the script using the command `python music_sorter.py`.
2. Follow the prompts to choose whether to sort by artist or album.

### file_sorter.py

The file_sorter.py script organizes files within a specified folder into categorized subfolders, such as music, books, videos, etc.

**Usage:**
1. Run the script using the command `python file_sorter.py`.
2. Follow the prompts to provide the folder path and select the sorting category.

## Find Location

The Find Location project is a script that returns all locations where a match to the given search term was found.

**Usage:**
1. Run the script `find_location.py`.
2. Follow the prompts to enter the search term.

## Emails

The Emails project is a work in progress.

## Lisp Interpreter

The Lisp Interpreter project is a basic implementation of a Lisp interpreter in Python.
